#Clean Data Project

###run_analysis.R
This script contains the cleanUpX() function which looks into the relative `./test` and `./train` directories to combine, clean up the data, and returns a summarised tidy data set. A data table is returned with summaries of the means and standard deviations per participant per activity.

No arguments are required, however it must be placed in the correct directory with the data in the test and train directories.
